There is a conceptual difference between BuildType and DeploymentType, although they may appear similar in the context of code structure:

*    BuildType: This typically refers to the type of build configuration used when compiling the application. Common build types include debug, release, profile, etc. Each build type can have different settings for optimization, logging, and feature flags that are appropriate for the stage of development or release.
*    DeploymentType: This usually refers to the environment or stage where the application is deployed. Common deployment types include dev (development), qa (quality assurance), staging, and prod (production). Each deployment type can represent a different server or environment setup with its own database, API endpoints, and configuration settings.

In practice, BuildType might affect how the application is compiled and packaged, while DeploymentType might influence how and where the application is run. Both are important in the software development lifecycle and are used to manage different aspects of application development and deployment.
