// TenantManager is a multi-tenant orchestration layer that organizes connections by role.
// It is typically derived from a flat Manager instance and allows structured access to:
// - Authentication connections (Auths)
// - Master infrastructure (Masters)
// - Tenant-specific scoped connections (Tenants)
//
// Additionally, it builds and stores AuthFlows, a method-to-adapter pipeline
// derived from the Auths list, which dictates how authentication methods are resolved.
type TenantManager struct {
	// Auths are authentication-related connections (e.g., LDAP, OIDC, SSO).
	// These are scanned to construct the AuthFlows used during login or auth workflows.
	Auths IConns `json:"auths,omitempty"`

	// Masters are primary infrastructure connections such as default databases, cache layers, etc.
	Masters IConns `json:"masters,omitempty"`

	// Tenants are tenant-specific connections (e.g., one DB per client, region-sharded services).
	Tenants IConns `json:"tenants,omitempty"`

	// AuthFlows is the ordered authentication pipeline derived from Auths.
	// Each method (primary, MFA, SSPR) maps to an ordered list of adapters.
	AuthFlows AuthPipeline `json:"authFlows,omitempty"`

// Each entry includes the ConnId, Adapter instance, and priority (from ConnTenantInfo).
